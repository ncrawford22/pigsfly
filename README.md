## Technical Challenges

- Working on some of the CRUD operations 
    - Could not decide what I wanted to actually update
- API issues
    - The API that I used is extremely complex. It is also no longer public, so there is not up to date documentation.


## Future Implementations

- Add and/or improve CRUD operations.
- Implement payment options for league members to pay annual dues
- Frontend updates
    - Make more mobile responsive
